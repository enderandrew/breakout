# HF Breakout
> Play, Design, and Share Breakout Levels

Starting as a basic tutorial for programming games, [https://github.com/jakesgordon](Jake Gordon) created this game to teach about game physics and utilizing HTML5 canvas to build fun and creative games. I've built on his work by adding a custom level generator, game powerups, additional levels, level names, online user counter, and more.

## Level Generator

A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._

## Powerups
`Powers have a 1 in 40 (2.5%) drop rate upon destroying blocks`

* Big Paddle
    * Makes your paddle 2x longer
* Small Paddle
    * CHANGE: Shrinks your paddle in half
* Extra Life
    * `You probably guessed it...` Gives an extra life
* Fireball
    * Turns the ball into molten lava, melting every brick in its path
* Multiball `(Work in Progress)`
    * Multiplies your ball into 3 smaller balls
* Sticky Paddle `(Work in Progress)`
    * Catches the ball on each paddle hit
