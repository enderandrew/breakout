Yesterday, 1/13/2019, I found an existing game (jakesgordon/javascript-breakout) that supported basic levels, a few colors, and score memory. I have added custom levels, level names, changed the theme, implemented a framework for powerups, and a whole lot more. I also wrote a level generator so members can make their own levels and request to add them to the publicly available game.[/list]

[size=large][u]Powerups[/u][/size]
[sp]
I broke the ball physics after trying to implement powerup drops, so for now, powerups apply instantly.
I plan to implement drops so you can dodge certain powerups, but I can't promise when that will be implemented.

Currently, powerups have a 1 in 40 (2.5%) chance of dropping per block destroyed.

[size=large][u]Plans/ To-Do[/u][/size]
[sp]
I plan to add to the game as long as the community enjoys the project.
With that being said, I am open to suggestions, but below are things planned:
[list]
[*][u]More Powerups:[/u] I am working on adding more power ups.
[*][u]More Levels:[/u]: With the help of the community, I would like to add many more levels.
[*][u]Users Playing:[/u] A feature that shows how many users are playing the game.
[*][u]Level Uploader:[/u] A feature that allows you to play levels you create without going through the approval process.
[*][u]and more![/u]

[size=large][u]Plans[/u][/size]
[sp]
[list]
[*][u]Level Upload:[/u] I created this editor so users could make and share games with the rest of the community. Right now, I have to add levels the community submits to be added to the game. But soon, I will implement the ability to upload created levels so you can plan them locally.
[*][u]Integrated Editor:[/u] I plan to integrate an editor so you can load levels as you are creating them.
[*][u]More Colors:[/u] There are 6-8 color slots open, so if the community decides on colors they would like to be in the game, I can add them
